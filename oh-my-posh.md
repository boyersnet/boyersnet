# oh-my-posh Configuration for Mac

The oh-my-posh configuration I use for both bash and powershell is a tribute to my alma mater [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu).  The colors I use are taken from their [branding guidelines](https://brand.vt.edu).

1. Install/Update oh-my-posh via iTerm2 and home brew.
```bash
brew upgrade oh-my-posh
```
or 
```bash
brew install oh-my-posh
```

2. Copy [`boyersnet.omp.json`](boyersnet.omp.json) oh-my-posh template to home directory.

3. (If Necessary) update [`.bash_profile`](.bash_profile) to load oh-my-posh template.
